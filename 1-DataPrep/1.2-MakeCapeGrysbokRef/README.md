# Prep Cape grysbok and eland reference genomes

## Cape grysbok genome
 - As described in the M&M and SI of the manuscript, we generated a Cape grysbok reference genome by mapping nuclear sequences (generated by us for another manuscript) to the sheep reference genome and called a consensus fasta sequence.
 - Scripts `1.2.1-*`, `1.2.2` and `MapWGS_nuclear_RmM001.sh` generate this reference sequence.

## Common eland reference genome
 - This genome "assembly" has 4,043,025 scaffolds, making it a bit clunky to work with.
 - Thus, we concatenated the longest 1,526,878 scaffolds that represent 90% of the length of the genome into 25 "SuperScaffolds" and used this as the reference genome.
 - The code to do this is in the script `1.2.3-prep_eland_refgenome.sh`.
