# DamageProfiler analysis
## All samples
 - Script `2.3.1-PalaeoBovids_compMap_nc_damageProfiler.slurm` generates ancient DNA damage profiles for all samples and libraries (some samples have multiple libraries).
 - The DamageProfiler output was then used to generated Figure S2.
 - See folder `4-Figures` for the plotting code.

## SCR vs BEST libraries comparison
 - Script `2.3.2-PalaeoBovids_libCompare_damageProfiler.slurm` was used to generate the read length distribution for the SCR and BEST libraries for samples RxA007 and ScA005, plotted in Figure 3.
 - See folder `4-Figures` for the plotting code.
